# IoT-Automatic-HandSanitizer-Dispenser
A touchless sanitizer  machine to reduce the risk due to contact. 

The system can sense the  proximity with the help of an ultrasonic sensor and sends a signal to the  microcontroller. The controller processes the sensor data &amp; actuates  the pump and solenoid valve. The sanitizer liquid dispenses through a  mist nozzle. And when it crosses a certain number of people it would  automatically fill the bottle.
